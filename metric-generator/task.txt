Create a solution (in either golang or python) designed to run on a Kubernetes Cluster to monitor internet urls and provide Prometheus metrics, once completed please upload your solution to your github.com account.  Please make it public.

Requirements:
    A service written in python or golang that queries 2 urls (https://httpstat.us/503 & https://httpstat.us/200)
    The service will check the external urls (https://httpstat.us/503 & https://httpstat.us/200 ) are up (based on http status code 200) and response time in milliseconds
    The service will run a simple http service that produces metrics using appropriate Prometheus libraries and outputs on /metrics
    Expected response format:
        sample_external_url_up{url="https://httpstat.us/503 "}  = 0
        sample_external_url_response_ms{url="https://httpstat.us/503 "}  = [value]
        sample_external_url_up{url="https://httpstat.us/200 "}  = 1
        sample_external_url_response_ms{url="https://httpstat.us/200 "}  = [value]

Success Criteria:
    Code in python or golang
    Dockerfile to build image
    Kubernetes Deployment Specification to deploy Image to Kubernetes Cluster
    Unit Tests
    README providing instructions for use
    Screen shots of deployment in Prometheus and accompanying Grafana Dashboard
